# HTMedia

Htmedia is a small extremely limited social media app that allows you to do **JUST** see and create posts. The biggest reason for this limitation is that the app's front-end itsef is built with HTML, SCSS and Javascript. Yep, no React, no Angular, not Front end framework. Although it is using SCSS because life is too short to write Plain CSS for a "big" project man. Well, If **YOU** want to try this extremely limited web app that can run on the Nintendo 64, then you can look into its source code in the <a href="#installation">installation</a> section
